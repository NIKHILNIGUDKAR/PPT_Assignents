        "The key steps involved in training and validating machine learning models are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data preparation: The data needs to be cleaned, preprocessed, and split into training and test sets.\n",
        "Model training: The model is trained on the training set using an algorithm such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines.\n",
        "Model validation: The model is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance.\n",
        "Model tuning: The hyperparameters of the model are tuned to improve its performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "Imbalanced datasets are datasets where there are more samples of one class than another. This can lead to problems with model performance, such as the model predicting the majority class all the time. There are a few ways to handle imbalanced datasets, such as:\n",
